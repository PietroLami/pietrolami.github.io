I am a Ph.D. student at Inria, my research topic focus on the theory of concurrent reversible programming languages and its application to the debugging of concurrent programs. Two main studies are proposed:
1. the automated derivation of a reversible semantics for concurrent languages;
2. the study of transaction programming abstractions through the lens of reversibiility. 

The supervision of my Ph.D. are [Ivan Lanese](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~lanese/) and [Jean-Bernard Stefani](https://team.inria.fr/spades/jean-bernard-stefani/).
